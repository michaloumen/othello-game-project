# Othello Game Project
This is the first project of the Ironhack Web Development course, where I reproduced the traditional game Othello.

## Introduction to the game
Othello is an board game is played by two parties on an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. Pieces have a black and white colour, each side representing one player. The goal for each player is to make pieces of their colour constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.

## Getting Started
This game works at the browser and doesn't need any installation.

## Prerequisites
No hardware prerequisites needed.

## Game rules
The goal is to get the majority of colour discs on the board at the end of the game. With the following rules:

* Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.

* The board will start with 2 black discs and 2 white discs at the centre of the board.

* Black always moves first.

* A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that flip one or more of the opponent's discs.

* The player cant  place a disc with empty positions between the opponent

* A disc can flip any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

* All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.

* If you can't flip at least one opposing disc, the turn will be passed to the opponent. However, if a move is available to you, you can't pass your turn.

* Once a disc has been placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.

* When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.

* The discs will be counted at the end of the game and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.

* A tie is possible.

## Game and Coding Improvements
