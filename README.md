# Othello Game Project

## Game rules
The goal is to get the majority of colour discs on the board at the end of the game. With the following rules:

* Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.

* The board will start with 2 black discs and 2 white discs at the centre of the board.

* Black always moves first.

* A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that flip one or more of the opponent's discs.

* The player cant  place a disc with empty positions between the opponent

* A disc can flip any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

* All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.

* If you can't flip at least one opposing disc, the turn will be passed to the opponent. However, if a move is available to you, you can't pass your turn.

* Once a disc has been placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.

* When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.

* The discs will be counted at the end of the game and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.

* A tie is possible.
